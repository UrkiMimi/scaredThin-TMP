# Lzy ShaderCam v0.0.4

A lazily put together shadercam method for Beat Saber custom models. Thrown together in about two (more like three) hours.
Please throw all concerns to me (dwmdotexe) on discord.

## Some known issues:
Can sometimes see non glow elements in the blur view.
(possibly) unoptimized. I haven't tested this on lower end hardware yet.
