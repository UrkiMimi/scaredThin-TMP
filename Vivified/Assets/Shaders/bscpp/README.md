## THESE MAY NOT WORK ON VIVIFY MAPS
Shaders that I've made for BSPTK. The majority of them were made with Amplify and may contain some internal code leftovers from the port. 

**You can use these shaders with custom models [Ex. Vivify maps, Custom Sabers] though be warned you may run into some problems due to the Beat Saber's modern bloomfog implementation not defining gamma correction.**

### Progress
Every shader used in 0.12.x has been worked on in some way. The fog engine these shaders use aren't 1:1 with 0.12.x but look fairly close with the right settings. BlueNoise isn't implemented.

Some shaders like the ParameticBox shader are omitted since they are decompiled [here.(OpenShaders-0.11.2)](https://github.com/whatdahopper/OpenShaders-0.11.2)
