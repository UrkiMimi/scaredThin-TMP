# scaredThin TMP
This is (almost) the whole source project for scaredThin. This includes the tools to build the map and the Unity project.

### Why is this not in Heckery?
I put this here cause of the dependency of the Unity project. This *could* go to [Heckery](https://github.com/UrkiMimi/Heckery) but I don't want to make it more of a mess than it is right now.

Models and textures provided by ZIK are swapped out with placeholders since almost all the assets from the [3D Demo/TMP2 Vinyl Campaign](https://youtu.be/Q4PYBJL-H6w?si=KpEMVGHOe1Wf-cVV) are private. 
Furthermore, other things like shader editor used for the majority of the `Urki` shaders is paid.

### Notes
I highly recommend having some basic knowledge of Python, Unity, and JSON before diving in. You should also take the [Heck documentation](https://heck.aeroluna.dev/) and Mawntee's Noodle video with you while you're scavenging through my messy code.

Also ask me before using any of the assets from this modchart in something else (ie. sabers). Please don't use any of the assets for profit or train them with generative AI algorithms!

### Requirements
For building sake. Things with `[R]` are recommended packages that aren't required for compilation

- Python `3.13.9` (Could work on lower version but largely untested)
- Unity `2019.4.18f1`
- Amplify Shader Editor `[R]`
