# scaredThin TMP
This is (almost) the whole source project for scaredThin. This includes the tools to build the map and the Unity project.

## Unity Project
Almost everything is here. The only things absent are assets that can't be distributed. Included but not limited to is the assets from the TMP2 Vinyl campaign and the bloom/main effect script.

The Unity side was built with Unity 2019.4.18f1

## Python files (hamen.main, etc)
